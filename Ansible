Ansible is a configaration managent tool and application deployment tool. ex: newlaptop

ADVANTAGES OF Ansible
=====================
1) Shell script is not work on the all linux distributions, where ansible works.

2) SCALABULITY:- difficulty to manage more number of linux servers.

3) shell script error handling is very toughf, everytime we needs to call the validation function.

4) shell script is not easy to understand, ansible is very easy to understand. everyone can easily understand.

5) To connect external systems like aws,azure and github we have modules to connect.

ANSIBLE Features
================

1) PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE: One ansible script that can work with all linux distributions.

2) SCLABLE: ansible can manage at a time thousand of servers, but shell script will run at a time one server.

3) IDEMPOTENCE: ansible is having the idempotence nature, that means if you run same program multiple times it wont get impact to server, where as shell script will create the damage.

4) ERROR HANDLING: Ansible will take care of error handling automatically.

5) READABLE AND MAINTANABLE: it is easy to understand the ansible program.

6) VAULT: Sensitive information like password to store we use ansible vault feature.

7) RICH MODULES: Ansible will have rich modules to connect with external systems like AWS, AZURE etc...

8) AGENTLESS: No needs to install the agent for the servers.

================================================================================================================
below command will work without installing the Ansible
------------------------------------------------------
sshpass -p "DevOps321" ssh centos@targetserver Ip adress --> ssh pass weused without prompt the password, after this command we are in target server(#exit is used to exit from the target server)

Note: -p means password "DevOps321"

Q) sshpass -p "DevOps321" ssh centos@ec2-54-172-160-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com -c "echo hello" > /tmp/krishna.txt --> this command will login to the node server and creating the "krishna.txt" file under /tmp folder.

yum install ansible -y --> To install ansible in Linux server

Ansible server works on the pushbased orchitecture no needs to install the agent in the target servers. Ansible server automatically connected with the target servers and push the configaration.

cheff is works on the pull based architecture. for this we needs to install the agent in the all target servers so the agents every 30 minits communicates with the cheff server and pull the new updates.
Disadvantages
-------------
1) Bandwith waste.
2) Resource consumption like CPU and Memory
3) Pull configaration have one advantage that is if any one is manually distrub the configaration in target servers that is going to correct the next configaration update automatically.

ansible -i 172.31.22.197, all -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ping --> this command will get ping response from the target server.
NOTE: i -- inventory
      m -- module , In ansible everything we called module. here "-m ping" --> Means ping module.

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html --> in this path we will see all modules.

if any module name is starts with the "ansible.builtin" it is developed by ansible team officially. if any popular tool in market for that we have ansible modules. if any module is not avilable then we will use community modules.

ansible -v -i 54.172.160.189, all -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 --become -m yum -a "name=nginx state=present" ==> this command will connect to ansible node server and install the package.
IMP NOTE:
OUTPUT red color means ERRORS
OUTPUT yellow color means changed
OUTPUT Green color means SUCCESS.

 ansible -v -i 54.172.160.189, all -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 --become -m service -a "name=nginx state=started" ==> To start the nginx service in target machines

To Keep all these modules in a file, that is nothing but a playbook.

ansible use yaml language it means "yet another markup language"

Q) what is a playbook?
A) Playbook is a collection of modules 

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -l web -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 ping.yaml
